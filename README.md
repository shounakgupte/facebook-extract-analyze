# Facebook-extract-analyse

Facebook processing library : extract & analyse data from pages, search...
Library to understand Facebook API by using Graph API Explorer, a good way to test and construct next functions

## TODO

- define local settings (cf. datetime for example)
- use Facebook PHP library
- extract data into MongoDB regarding next reviews
- analyse data from MongoDB

## Notes

- refer to Graph API Explorer : https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer
- index of the Graph API functions : https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.1/
- use Access Token generated by Graph API Explorer
- Note use of paging (same as in Twitter)
